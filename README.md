Inventory App
=============

Let's practice some design patterns whilst building an inventory app.

The client has asked us for the following features:

- We'd like to keep track of stocks off foodstuffs, household items and so on
that are kept in the panty.
  - Create
  - Read
  - Update
  - Delete
- We'd like a notification when goods arrive, and when they fall below a certain
stock level
- We'd like a report of what stocks are currently in the panty, with the company
letterhead and the date, then a break-down of the items in a footer. We'd like
them in plain text, HTML and PostScript format.
- We'd like to be able to save the stock information into a file.
- We'd like to be able to undo any alteration to the stock information
